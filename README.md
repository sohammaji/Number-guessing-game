### How to play
    1. The computer selects a random number between 1 to 100.

    4. Similarly when your guess is less than the actual number, the computer tells you enter a higher number.
    5. The process keeps going until you guess the correct number.
    6. After the correct number is guessed, the result is printed which shows how many attempts you have taken to guess it.
